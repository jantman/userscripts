Some of my UserScripts

## [CopyMarkdownLink](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jantman/userscripts/master/CopyMarkdownLink.user.js)

Copy page title and location as a markdown link context menu entry, removing annoying Jira square-bracketed title.

## [TrelloContextMenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jantman/userscripts/master/TrelloContextMenu.user.js)

Add page to a Trello board via context menu, with special handling for Jira, GitHub, FogBugz, Redmine and RT issues, Gmail, and ReviewBoard code reviews.

Loads a list of all of your boards and lists, and provides a context menu to add the current page to one of them.

Also handles adding any selected text to the description.
